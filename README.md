## Che Zhu

Full-stack developer at Labring. 

I hold a Master’s in AI/ML from the University of Adelaide and a Bachelor’s in ICT from Western Sydney University, both in Australia.

Currently pursuing Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), with the goal of completing it by 2025.
- As a significant portion of my work requires a solid understanding of Kubernetes. The CKA certification ensures I understand the platform (sealos) deeply enough to write better code that interacts with it. You know, instead of just letting Claude Code do the work and hoping for the best.

Active in the broader open-source community. Contribute to various projects and do voluntary translation work for privacy-focused companies.

Personal projects tend toward accessibility technology and ML applications where the code can make a tangible difference in people’s lives.

**My Philosophy:** Doing is learning. 
- I test 3-5 ideas per year by building them. Most fail. A few succeed. None bothers me. All teach something.
