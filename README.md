## Che Zhu

Full-stack developer at Labring. Master's in AI/ML from Adelaide Uni, Australua, Bachelor's in ICT from Western Sydney, Australia.

Currently pursuing Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Certification (by 2025) â€” because a significant portion of my code needs to communicate with Kubernetes APIs. The CKA certification ensures I understand the platform deeply enough to write better application code that interacts with it. You know, instead of just letting Claude Code do the work and hoping for the best.

Active in the broader open-source community. Contribute to various projects and do voluntary translation work for privacy-focused companies.

Personal projects tend toward accessibility tech and ML applications where the code actually helps people.

**My Philosophy:** Doing is learning. I test 3-5 ideas per year by building them. Most fail. A few work. All teach something.
